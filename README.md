# Word Cloud Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple Word Cloud Generator written in Python. It takes a text input, analyzes the frequency of words, and generates a visual representation (word cloud) where the size of each word reflects its frequency in the text.

## What is Word Clouding?
Word clouding is a technique used to visualize the most frequent words in a body of text. Words that appear more often are displayed larger and bolder, making it easy to identify key themes and topics at a glance. Word clouds are commonly used in data analysis, presentations, and reports to summarize textual data.

## Features
